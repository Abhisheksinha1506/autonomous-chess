# Principles Behind the Autonomous Chess Repository ♟️

This repository is like a living chessboard. Every commit is a move. Every reset is a new game.
It plays forever, without human players, exploring the vast universe of chess.

## Autonomy
- The system is entirely self-contained within GitHub Actions.
- No human input is required to sustain the game.

## Determinism vs. Emergence
- While move selection can be deterministic (e.g., picking the first available move), the complexity of chess ensures emergent patterns and unique game histories.

## Self-Documentation
- The history of the simulation is preserved in the git commits and the `moves_log.md`.
